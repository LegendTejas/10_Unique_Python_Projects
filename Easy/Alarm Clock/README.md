# ‚è∞ Alarm Clock

A simple command-line **Alarm Clock** built using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
Set a timer in minutes and seconds, and the alarm will play a sound when the time is up.

---

### üß† How It Works
1. The program asks for:
   - Minutes to wait  
   - Seconds to wait  
2. It counts down the time in the terminal.  
3. When the timer reaches zero, it plays a sound file (e.g., `samsung.mp3`) using **Pygame**.  
4. The alarm continues until stopped manually (Ctrl+C).

---

### How to Run
1. Install pygame:
```
   pip install pygame
```

2. Place your sound file (e.g., samsung.mp3) in the same folder.
3. Run the script:
```
python alarm_clock.py
```
