# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

A simple **Python-based Password Generator** that creates strong and customizable passwords.  
Users can choose the **minimum length**, and whether to include **numbers** and **special characters**.  
It also includes basic **error handling** for invalid inputs.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program asks for:
   - Minimum password length  
   - Whether to include numbers (`y/n`)  
   - Whether to include special characters (`y/n`)  
2. It then generates a random password that meets your selected criteria.  
3. If invalid input is entered (like text instead of a number), the program shows an appropriate error message.
